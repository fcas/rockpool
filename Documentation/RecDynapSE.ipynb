    "## Choosing tDt\n",
    "As with all layers, a `RecDynapSE` object's evolution takes place in discrete time steps. This allows to send an `nNumTimeSteps` argument to the `evolve` method, which is consistent with other layer classes and important for the use within a `Network`. Besides, event though the hardware evolves in continuous time, the input events use discrete timesteps. These timesteps are $\\frac{10^{-7}}{9} \\text{ s} = 11.\\bar{1} \\cdot 10^{-9} \\text{ s}$ and mark the smallest value that can be chosen for the layer timestep `tDt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the effect the timestep size has on computation time is much smaller than with other layers, it is not always advisable to choose the smallest possible value. The reason is that the number of timesteps between two input spikes is currently limited to $2^{16}-1 = 65535$. This means that with tDt $= 11.\\overline{1} \\cdot 10^{-9} \\text{ s}$, any section in the  input signal without input spikes longer than about 0.73 milliseconds will cause the layer to throw an exception. Therefore it makes sense to set `tDt` to something between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-4}$ seconds, in order to allow for sufficiently long silent parts in the input while still maintaining a good temporal resolution.\n",

Each input channel of the layer corresponds to such a virtual neuron. Every neuron on the DynapSE has a logical ID, which ranges from 0 to 4095 for the physical and from 0 to 1023 for the virtual neurons. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!--- (probably not necessary) An input spike to the layer translates to a virtual neuron emitting a spike. If a neuron is set to receive spikes from a neuron with ID $n$, it makes no difference if a virtual or a pysical neuron with this ID is firing. The target neuron will receive the spikes in both cases. Because this can cause unexpected behavior it is recommended that the IDs of the physical neurons are pairwise different from the IDs of of the virtual neurons.\n",

    "### Neuron states\n",
    "Hardware neurons' states change constantly according to the laws of physics, even when the layer is currently not evolving, and there is no state variable that could be read out for all neurons simultaneously. Therefore the `RecDynapSE` has no state vector like other layer classes. The `vState` attribute is just a 1D array of `nSize` zeros.\n",

    "## Synapses\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four different synapse types on the DynapSE: fast and slow excitatory as well as fast and slow inhibitory. Each neuron can receive inputs through up to 64 synapses, each of which can be any of the given types. Via `cortexcontrol` the synaptic behavior can be adjusted for each type and for each core, but not for individual synapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a priori no difference between slow and fast excitatory synapses, so they can be set to have the same behavior. In fact, one could assign shorter time constants to the \"slow\" excitatory synapses, making them effectively the fast ones. While both excitatory and the fast inhibitory synapses work by adding or subtracting current to the neuron membrane, the slow inhibitory synapses use shunt inhibition and in practice silence a neuron very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all synapses that are of the same type and that are on the same core have the same weight. Different connection strengths between neurons can only be achieved by setting the same connection multiple times. Therefore the weight matrices `mfWIn` and `mfWRec` can only be positive or negative integers and thus determine the number of excitatory and inhibitory connections to a neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this layer the connections from external input to layer neurons are fast excitatory or inhibitory synapses. Outgoing connections from neurons that receive external input are fast excitatory or inhibitory. Outgoing connecitons from other neurons are slow excitatory and fast inhibitory. For different configurations the `_compile_weights_and_configure` method has to be modified.  Felix can help you with this.\n",

    "## Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "The `evolve` method takes the standard arguments `tsInput`, `tDuration`, `nNumTimeSteps` and `bVerbose`, which is currently not being used. Evolution duration is determined by the usual rules. If `tsInput` is provided, it must be a `TSEvent` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is sent to the hardware neurons which will evolve and spike. The neurons' spikes are collected in a `TSEvent` object with the timings and IDs of the spiking neurons. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the hardware neurons continue evolving, so in contrast to software simulations, the layer will be in a different state (membrane potentials etc.) when an evolution begins than when the previous evolution ended. Because evolution happens in batches, this even happens between some of the timesteps within the evolution (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolution in batches\n",
    "As for now it is not possible to stream events (input spikes) continuously to the DynapSE. Therefore a group of events is transferred to the hardware, temporarily stored there and then translated to spikes of virtual neurons, with temporal order and inter-spike intervals matching the input signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of events that can be sent at once is limited. To allow for arbitrarily long layer evolution times, the input can be split into batches, during each of which a number of events is sent and \"played back\" to the hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of splitting the full input signal into batches. First, a new batch ends, as soon as it contains the maximum number of spikes or lasts the maximum allowed batch duration. These values can be set for each `RecDynapSE` object and are stored in the `nMaxEventsPerBatch` and `tMaxBatchDur` attributes. While the former is limited by the hardware to be at most $2^{16}-1 = 65535$, the latter can be set to `None`, which in principle allows for arbitrarily long batch durations. However, the length of any inter-spike interval is currently limited, too, so effectively the batch duration is limited also in this case (see <i>Choosing tDt</i> for more details).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that because the hardware neurons keep evolving after a batch ends, their state (membrane potentials etc.) will have changed until the next batch starts. These discontinuities could be problematic for some simulations. In particular if the input data consists of trials, no trial should be divided over two batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way of splitting batches considers this scenario and by splitting the input only at the beginnings of trials. The number of trials in a batch is determined by the layer's `nMaxTrialPerBatch` attribute. If a batch with this number of trials contains more events or lasts longer than allowed, the number of trials is reduced accordingly. This method is used if the input time series has a `vtTrialStarts` attribute, that indicates the start time of each trial, and if `nMaxTrialsPerBatch` is not `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> \n",

    "## Resetting\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual the layer's time and state can be reset by the `reset_time`, `reset_state` and `reset_all` methods. However, since there is no state vector in this class, `reset_state` has no effect and `reset_all` effectively does the same as `reset_time`.\n",
