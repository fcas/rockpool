    "## Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go into the details of how the class works, let us first have a brief look at some properties of the DynapSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DynapSE processor consists of 4 chips. Each chips has 4 cores of 256 neurons. The chips, as well as each core in a chip and each neuron in a core are identified with an ID between 0 and 3 or 0 and 256, respectively. However, this class uses logical IDs from 0 to 4095 that range over all neurons. In other words the logical neuron ID is $1024 \\cdot \\text{ChipID} + 256 \\cdot \\text{CoreID} + \\text{NeuronID}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting connections\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Synapse types\n",
    "There are four different synapse types on the DynapSE: fast and slow excitatory as well as fast and slow inhibitory. Each neuron can receive inputs through up to 64 synapses, each of which can be any of the given types. Via `cortexcontrol` the synaptic behavior can be adjusted for each type and for each core, but not for individual synapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a priori no difference between slow and fast excitatory synapses, so they can be set to have the same behavior. In fact, one could assign shorter time constants to the \"slow\" excitatory synapses, making them effectively the fast ones. While both excitatory and the fast inhibitory synapses work by adding or subtracting current to the neuron membrane, the slow inhibitory synapses use shunt inhibition and in practice silence a neuron very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all synapses that are of the same type and that are on the same core have the same weight. Different connection strengths between neurons can only be achieved by setting the same connection multiple times. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the routing scheme\n",
    "In particular if you want to implement complex or large networks that span over several cores, it is helpful to understand how connections are set on the DynapSE. Each neuron has 4 SRAM and 64 CAM cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### SRAM\n",
    "The SRAM cells determine where each neuron sends its output events, in other words, this will affect postsynaptic connections of the neuron. You can specify the following parameters:\n",
    "- `target_chip_id` $\\in [0, 4)$: ID of chip to which events are sent.\n",
    "- `core_mask` $\\in [0, 16)$: This value is converted to a 4-digit binary value, where each digit corresponds to one core and determines if this core receives events (1) or not (0).\n",
    "- `virtual_core_id` $\\in [0, 4)$: Neurons receive events from specific cores (see below). If this value is changed, the sending neuron pretends that it belongs to a different core than it actually does.\n",
    "Because each neuron has 4 SRAM cells it can send events to up to 4 chips.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### CAM\n",
    "In each CAM cell the neuron can be set to listen to (i.e. receive events from) one other neuron. In other words, presynaptic connections are set here. The following parameters can be set:\n",
    "- `pre_neuron_ID` $\\in [0, 256)$: The presynaptic neuron's ID within its core.\n",
    "- `pre_neuron_core_ID` $\\in [0, 1024)$: The core of the presynaptic neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two values together uniquely define a presynaptic neuron on a single chip. From which chips the postsynaptic neuron receives the events is determined by which neurons (with corresponding ID and core) send to the core where the postsynaptic neuron is located (i.e. the presynaptic neurons must have matching `target_chip_id` and `core_mask` in their SRAMs (see above).\n",
    "- `type`: The synapse type of this connection.\n",
    "The `type`s are `DynapseCamType` objects that can be accessed from the `dynapse_control` module as: `SynapseTypes.<type>` where `<type>` is `FAST_EXC`, `SLOW_EXC`, `FAST_INH` or `SLOW_INH`. Using the `DynapseControl` class these synapse typse can be accessed as `DynapseControl.synFE`, `DynapseControl.synSE`, `DynapseControl.synFI` and  `DynapseControl.synSI`, respectively.\n",
    "Becuase each neuron has 64 CAM cells, it can have at most 64 presynaptic connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sending events\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Virtual neurons\n",
    "Inputs are sent to the hardware through so-called virtual neurons. Every virtual neuron on the DynapSE has a logical ID, which ranges from 0 to 1023.  An event that is sent to the hardware translates into a virtual neuron emitting a spike.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a physical neuron $m$ is set to receive spikes from a neuron with logical ID $n$, it makes no difference if a virtual or a pysical neuron with this ID is firing (as long as the firing neuron's target chip IDs and core masks include the location $m$). Neuron $m$ will receive the spikes in both cases. Because this can cause unexpected behavior it is recommended that the IDs of the physical neurons are pairwise different from the IDs of of the virtual neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FPGA\n",
    "As for now it is not possible with `DynapseControl` to stream events continuously to the DynapSE. Instead, events are first sent to an FPGA, temporarily stored there and then translated to spikes of virtual neurons, with temporal order and inter-spike intervals matching the input signal. The number of events that can be sent at once is limited to $2^{16} - 1 = 65535$. Longer inputs need to be split up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inter-spike intervals must be multiples of a time step, which in `DynapseControl` is stored as `tFpgaIsiBase`. This time step, in return,  needs to be a multiple of $11.\\overline{1} \\cdot 10^{-9} \\text{ s}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the size of `tFpgaIsiBase` has no effect on computation time, it is not always advisable to choose the smallest possible value. The reason is that the number of timesteps between two input spikes is limited to $2^{16}-1 = 65535$. This means that with `tFpgaIsiBase` $= 11.\\overline{1} \\cdot 10^{-9} \\text{ s}$, any inter-spike interval longer than about 0.73 milliseconds is already above the limit. `DynapseControl` will automatically reduce inter-spike intervals that are too long by inserting \"dummy\" events that are not routed to any neuron on the chip. However, if too many are inserted, the maximum number of input events can be exceeded and the input will have to be split up. In this case a `MemoryError` will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore it makes sense to set `tFpgaIsiBase` to something between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-4}$ seconds, in order to allow for sufficiently long silent parts in the input while still maintaining a good temporal resolution. Alternatively one could send dummy events that do not target any physical neuron. However, transmission of events to the processor is not the fastest and the more events are sent, the longer it takes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Receiving events\n",
    "In order to record the firing activity of neurons `EventFilter` and `BufferedEventFilter` objects can be used. Each can be set to listen to a specific population of neurons. `EventFilter`s will call a callback function, each time one of the specified neurons fires. `BufferedEventFilter`s will store `event` objects in a buffer until they are fetched. For more details refer to the <a href=\"http://ai-ctx.gitlab.io/ctxctl/primer.html#CtxDynapse.EventFilter\">cortexcontrol documentation</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently the `DynapseControl` class only supports the use of a single `BufferedEventFilters`, which can be added or changed with the `add_buffered_filter` method. It will stop recording when the `clear_buffered_filter` method is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"red\">\n",
    "- EventFilter and BufferedEventFilter\n",
    "</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time constants for neurons\n",
    "For each core the neuron time constants can be set through the biases `IF_TAU1_N` and `IF_TAU2_N`. Higher values correspond to shorter time constants and effectively make it less likely that the neurons will fire. For each neuron you can choose which of the two time constant biases applies. This can be useful, for example by setting the value of `IF_TAU2_N` very high, making it almost impossible for a neuron to fire. Neurons that fire in an uncontrollable way (so-called hot neurons) can then be silenced by assigning them `TAU2` instead of `TAU1`.\n",
    "Neurons are assigned `TAU2` with the `silence_neurons` method. All neurons of specified cores are assigned `TAU1` with the `reset_silencing` method. Note that the names of these methods are chosen under the assumption that the bias for `TAU2` has been set to a high value. The neurons are not silenced per se by those methods.\n",
