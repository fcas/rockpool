    "The purpose of the `VirtualDynapse` class is to provide and understanding of which operations are possible with neuromorphic chips such as DynapSE and which constraints may apply. It is not to be seen as a detailled simulation of the underlying circuits. Neuronal dynamics are approximated with the *adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model* (<a href=\"http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Adaptive_exponential_integrate-and-fire_model\">AEIF</a>) with <a href=\"https://www.nest-simulator.org/\">NEST</a> as simulation backend. Tuneable parameters are indicative of which aspects of neuron dynamics can be modified but do not correspond directly to paramaters used to configure the actual hardware. Not all possible ways of configuring paramters or synaptic connection may be covered. Mismatch is approximated by drawing individual neuron parameters from a Gaussian distribution with the provided value as mean."

    "## Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter gives a brief overview over the neuromorphic hardware that this class simulates.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "### Neuron model\n",
    "The dynamics of the neurons on a Dynap-SE processor can be approximately described by the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model (<a href=\"http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Adaptive_exponential_integrate-and-fire_model\">AEIF</a>), with spike-triggered adaptation. The resting potential ($E_L$ in the link) is implicitly 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchy\n",
    "Dynap-SE chips consist of multiple cores, each with a certain number of neurons (e.g. Dynap-SE 1: 4 cores pre chip, 256 neurons per core). Multiple chips can be used together (e.g. Dynap-SE 1 development kit: 4 chips) to implement larger networks. **Neuron parameters are set on a per-core basis,** meaning that all neurons in one core share the same set of parameters. In practice, (mismatch)[#mismatch] ensures that there is still variability in neuron dynamics, even within a core.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "### Connectivity\n",
    "For each neuron the number of presynaptic neurons from which it can receive events as well as the number of chips to which a neuron's spikes can be routed are limited. Standard values are guided by the specifications of Dynap-SE 1. For other models these constraints may look different. Furthermore some of the constraints may be circumvented by techniques such as virtual core IDs (see `DynapseControl` documentation for more details), which are not simulated in this class, and connection aliasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connection aliasing\n",
    "A postsynaptic neuron cannot distinguish between events from neurons that are from different chips but have the same ID within their respective chip. This also includes external input channels to the neuron. If events from such neurons are routed to the core of the postsynaptic neuron, it will respond to all of them, even if it should only be connected to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice this means, that situations should be avoided where two neurons on the same core have presynaptic connections to neurons that are on different chips but have same IDs within their chips. The `VirtualDynapse` class will warn or raise an exception in such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, connection aliasing can also be used to increase the fan-in of a neuron, in particular in conjunction with virtual core IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "### <a name=\"mismatch\"></a>Mismatch\n",
    "Due to the analog nature of the silicon neurons and their device mismatch, temporal and functional characteristics vary between individual neurons and synapses. This intrinsic inhomogeneity is usually exploited to introduce variability in neuron parameters and enhance signal dimensionality. The `VirtualDynapse` class can include mismatch in its simulations."
