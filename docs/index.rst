Welcome to |project|
================================

|project| is a Python package for working with dynamical neural networks architectures, particularly for designing
networks for Neuromorphic computing hardware. |project| provides a convenient interface for designing, training
and evaluating recurrent networks, which can operate both with continuous-time dynamics and event-driven dynamics.

|project| is an open-source project managed by aiCTX AG.
