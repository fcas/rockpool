Documentation for NetworksPython
================================

NetworksPython is a Python package for working with dynamics neural networks architectures, particularly for designing
networks for Neuromorphic computing hardware. NetworksPython provides a convenient interface for designing, training
and evaluating recurrent networks, which can operate both with continuous-time dynamics and event-driven dynamics.

NetworksPython is an open-source project produced by aiCTX AG.
