However, this can be extenden by assigning the same virtual core ID to neurons with on different cores. This way the fan-in can in theory be multiplied by at most the number of available cores (e.g. on a DynapSE development kit 16). Furthermore, connection aliasing could be used to multiply the fan-in by the number of available chips (i.e. 4 on a development kit).\n",

Instead, events are first sent to an FPGA, temporarily stored there and then translated to spikes of virtual neurons, with temporal order and inter-spike intervals matching the input signal. The number of events that can be sent at once is limited to $2^{16} - 1 = 65535$. Longer inputs need to be split up.\n",

    "Although the size of `fpga_isibase` has no effect on computation time, it is not always advisable to choose the smallest possible value. The reason is that the number of timesteps between two input spikes is limited to $2^{16}-1 = 65535$. This means that with `fpga_isibase` $= 11.\\overline{1} \\cdot 10^{-9} \\text{ s}$, any inter-spike interval longer than about 0.73 milliseconds is already above the limit. `DynapseControl` will automatically split up inter-spike intervals that are too long by inserting \"dummy\" events that are not routed to any neuron on the chip. However, if too many are inserted, the maximum number of input events can be exceeded and the input will have to be split up. In this case a ValueError will be raised.\n",

    "### Time constants for neurons\n",
    "For each core the neuron time constants can be set through the biases `IF_TAU1_N` and `IF_TAU2_N`. Higher values correspond to shorter time constants and effectively make it less likely that the neurons will fire. For each neuron you can choose which of the two time constant biases applies. This can be useful, for example by setting the value of `IF_TAU2_N` very high, making it almost impossible for a neuron to fire. Neurons that fire in an uncontrollable way (so-called hot neurons) can then be silenced by assigning them `TAU2` instead of `TAU1`.\n",
    "Neurons are assigned `TAU2` with the `silence_neurons` method. All neurons of specified cores are assigned `TAU1` with the `reset_silencing` method. Note that the names of these methods are chosen under the assumption that the bias for `TAU2` has been set to a high value. The neurons are not silenced per se by those methods."

    "To avoid multiple layers (such as the `RecDynapSE` class) referencing the same neurons on the hardware, `DynapseControl` keeps track of which neurons are already in use. The same happens for [virtual neurons](#virtual_neurons). An array with a boolean for each (virtual) neuron that indicates whether it is still available can be accessed through `DynapseControl.hwneurons_isavailable` (`DynapseControl.virtualneurons.isavailable`). If a layer wants to be assigned a population of (virtual) neurons, it can call `DynapseControl.allocate_hw_neurons` (`DynapseControl.allocate_virtual_neurons`). If an array of integers is passed as argument, the method will try to assign the neurons with corresponding logical IDs or raise a `ValueError` if some of them are already assigned. If an integer $n$ is passed, it will assign $n$ available neurons. In both cases an array with the logical IDs of the assigned neurons is returned and the neurons are marked as not free.\n",

This allows for a more efficient update mechanism, in particular if only few neurons have been modified. To access shadow state neurons from within the `DynapseControl` class, there is the `shadow_neurons` attribute, a list with references to all shadow state neurons ordered by their logical ID.
