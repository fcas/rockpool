Checklist for releasing a new |project| version
===================================================

- Make sure the version number in ``version.py`` has been bumped. We use semantic versioning: ``major.minor.maintenance.(postN)``, where ``(postN)`` is only for hotfixes
- Make a release candidate branch ``rc/<version>`` from ``develop`` branch on internal gitlab
- Merge ``master`` into ``rc/...`` to make sure all changes are merged
- Make a merge request from ``rc/...`` into ``master``
- Get all primary developers to review the merge request, ensure that all suggested modifications are included
- Ensure that all pipelines pass, **including manual pipelines**
- Update ``CHANGELOG.md`` using ``git log X..Y --oneline``
- Once the merge has succeeded, delete the ``rc/...`` branch
- Make and push a tag to the ``master`` branch for the new version (i.e. "vX.Y.Z")
- Once all CI tasks have succeeded, a manual CI task "pypi_deploy" will be available. Run this task to deploy to PyPI. **This take must be run from the internal Rockpool repository**
- A pull request for the `conda feedstock <https://github.com/conda-forge/rockpool-feedstock>`_ should be created automatically by a conda-forge bot. Check and merge this PR to bump the version on ``conda-forge``
- Bump the version number in the ``develop`` branch to something like "vX.Y.Z.dev"
